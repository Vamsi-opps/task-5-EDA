# task-5-EDA

 Overview

a synopsis of EDA's goals.

 Step 0: Reading Data and Importing

imported the necessary libraries Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas.

The coaster dataset was loaded into a DataFrame.

Step 1: Understanding the Data

investigated the data types, shape, and fundamental statistics of the dataset.

Head() and tail() were used to preview the data, and describe() was used to summarize the numerical features.

Step 2: Preparing the Data

handled duplicate entries and removed unnecessary columns.

Columns have been renamed for clarity.

cleaned up inconsistent and missing values.

Step 3: Understanding Features (Univariate Analysis)

examined key feature distributions.

Data visualization techniques included bar plots, KDE plots, and plotted histograms.

Step 4: Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis of Feature Relationships

investigated feature relationships using heatmaps, scatterplots, and pairplots.
